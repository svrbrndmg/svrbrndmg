Why don't we use this little Github default template, eh?
- 👋 Hi, I’m @svrbrndmg
- 👀 I’m interested in gamedev, coding and writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS, but you likely won't see much of that here on Github. Before that I used to work in Python.
- 📫 How to reach me: [email me](mailto:svrbrndmg@proton.me), or DM @svrbrndmg on discord.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/any

     - ✔️ [Hardcore Idler](https://svrbrndmg.itch.io/hardcore-idler) - done. it's my first big game. please play it
     - ✔️ [Physics Toy](https://github.com/svrbrndmg/physics-toy) - probably won't add more onto it. it's fun enough even at this point. weee!
     - ✔️ [Pong Clone](https://github.com/svrbrndmg/pong) - yeah, I don't really wanna add more to this. Or feel that I need to. It's a Pong clone.
